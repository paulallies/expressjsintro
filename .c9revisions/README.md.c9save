So after installing\r\n    <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">nodejs</a>, we need to install \r\n    <a href=\"http://expressjs.com\">express.</a>.  So what is express?  It is a \r\n    web application framework for node, much like what asp.net mvc is for .net.  We install \r\n    express via <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/\">npm</a> which is a package manager for node.  \r\n    We use npm to install modules for nodejs much like apt-get for debian based \r\n    linux systems or nuget for .net.  I won't cover the installation of node and\r\n    npm in this tutorial.  Anyway, back to the installation of express.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating Your First Application</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Create a folder for your applicaiton and within the folder, install express:\r\n    \r\n        $ npm install express\r\n        \r\n    This command will install the express framework module under a folder \r\n    called node_modules.\r\n    \r\n    To create a starting point for our application we can ask express to generate \r\n    so files and folders with the following command:\r\n    \r\n        $ ./node_modules/express/bin/express\r\n        \r\n    on \"destination is not empty, continue?\" answer \"Y\".  We now see some files \r\n    files and folders under the project folder.  We can run the web application \r\n    with the following command:\r\n    \r\n        $ node app.js\r\n        \r\n    this will allow the site to be hosted on http://localhost:3000.  Browsing to\r\n    this site on your browser shows an error of:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n     <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/paulallies/expressjsintro/master/tutorial/JadeError.PNG\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>        \r\n    \r\n    Express be default wants jade as it's view engine. I like handlebars so to \r\n    install the handlebars view engine we do the following:\r\n    \r\n        $ npm install hbs\r\n        \r\n    We also need to register hbs as our view engine within the app.js file.  Change\r\n    the file following:\r\n    \r\n        app.set('view engine', 'jade');\"    \r\n            to\r\n        app.set('view engine', 'hbs');\"\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r"],[0,"\n</p"]],"start1":2630,"start2":2630,"length1":2128,"length2":8}]],"length":2639,"saved":false}
